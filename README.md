# Roll20-HeroQuest
A modification on the classic HeroQuest game sheets, available to use on Roll20.net

This is entirely a hobby project for myself and my friends. Should you wish to use this, however, for your own hobby gaming, you are more than welcome to do so!

## The Character Sheet
The `png` file can be uploaded for use.
Navigate to your game, then clicking the gear icon for 'Settings', and choosing 'Game Settings'. The Character Sheet Template will be at the bottom of the page. The `HeroQuestCharacterSheet.html` file can be copied and pasted into the terminal window Roll20 gives you, in the HTML tab. The CSS file `HeroQuestStyling.css` can also be copied and pasted into the CSS tab here. (Though, truth be told, I tried to just use in-line styling here, mostly to avoid swapping between files when I was working on this.)

## Custom Dice Mechanics*
I took an existing roll mechanics page from someone named "Konrad J." and modified it to fit the usage of my own taste, and that of the evolving play my friends and I have made this game into. 

The file `HeroQuestDice` can be copied and pasted into the terminal window supplied by Roll20 in 'API Scripts' section of the Settings.

The usage for these commands, which can be used in your macros section in the Roll20 game, can be found in the file comments at the top. 

* This section still needs cleanup and work. The state of the file I started with was not to my personal taste in terms of styling and build. I will also be breaking out the victory-narration-generator at some point. 

_sorry if the profanity in the victory-narration-generator is offputting for you_
